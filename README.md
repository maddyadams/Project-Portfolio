# Fence

When I started fencing, I looked on the App Store for an app that would keep score and time, but every app I found shared the same problem: when you tapped on the screen to start the timer, you had to look down for a second to make sure the timer was running. Even worse, you had the same problem when you went to stop the timer, drawing your eyes away from the fencers right when you should be watching them closely. 

Fence! is an iPhone app I wrote about two years ago which solves these problems in two ways. First, the entire screen is yellow if the timer is running, and white if the timer is stopped, allowing you to look out of the corner of your eye to see if the timer is running. Second, I added the option to use a "deadman switch"; instead of tapping to start and stop the timer, you tap and hold on the screen to start the timer, and then release to stop. The end result is an app which has a simpler and cleaner UI, as well as a better experience for the referee.

# CPS Schedule

In the middle of my freshman year, my school announced that they would be making drastic changes to the schedule. Instead of having the same classes in the same order every single day, we would have a two-week rotating block schedule with a mix of 45 and 75 minute classes. Instead of trying to memorize the schedule, I decided to make an app. 

CPS Schedule is designed to be as streamlined as possible for the moments in between classes. When you open the app, it shows the class you have next in a simple, uncluttered interface. Switch to a different tab, and it shows you the classes you have on a particular day. There's even a widget for it, so you can see your schedule right from your lockscreen.

# AR Note Blocks

One day, I was thinking about how there are different variations of visual art. Paintings and photographs don't vary over time, but movies are dynamic over time. So if music is dynamic over time, what would be the equivalent of unvarying music? Here's one answer to that question. 

AR Note Blocks is an experimental musical augmented reality app. You create blocks that play different notes. The blocks are anchored in space (i.e. they don't move around). However, as you move closer to or farther away from the blocks, the notes' volumes change.
